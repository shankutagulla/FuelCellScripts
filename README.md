Fuel Cell Project Script Repository
Author(s): Shan Kutagulla
Organization: University of Texas At Austin

Purpose of Repository:
1. EIS Curve Analysis: Script will extract from an EIS curve generated by Scribner's software. Outputs include the HFR of the PEMFC (leftmost minima) and efficiency comparison to bare Nafion.
2. Linear Sweep Voltammetry Analysis: Script will extract from the Squidstat curve. Outputs include the short resistance (in Ohms) and crossover/unit area for the MEA.
